    <h1>About Motion Sickness Gaming</h1>
    <h3>Author</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Lisa Clark and I developed this site for a project as part of my Diploma in Website Development. If you would like to know more about me and what I have worked on please feel free to check out my <a href="https://kandigalaxy.website" target="_blank">portfolio</a>. I have also created a <a href="https://twitter.com/kandigalaxy" target="_blank">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/motion_sickness_gaming/" target="_blank">instagram</a> account for Motion Sickness Gaming, please follow to see when new games and fixes have been added.</p>
    <p>If this site becomes popular, then I will continue to add updates to this site. I will probably also add a donation button through Paypal and/or Ko-fi to keep the community going, because hosting and domains cost money.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy using this site, and if you come across any bugs or have any ideas to make this site better please visit the <a href="contact.php">contact</a> page.</p>
    <h3>Reputation</h3>
    <p>There are 2 types of reputation that you can level up. Comments reputation and Fix reputation. Each thumbs up/down for a comment or reply contributes to your Comment reputation and each thumbs up/down for your fixes contributes to your Fix reputation.</p>
    <p>1 point is added to your reputation for each thumbs up, 1 point is deducted from your reputation for each thumbs down.</p>
    <p>Each type has 3 levels as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <h4>Comments Reputation</h4>
        <li>0-50 points: Newbie</li>
        <li>51-500 points: Partially Sick Member</li>
        <li>501+ points: Fully Sick Member</li>
        <h4>Fix Reputation</h4>
        <li>1-100 points: Beginner Fixer</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Avatars</h3>
    <p>Upon sign up you automatically are set up with the default avatar. If you wish to change it please go to "Your Account" page and click on the "Change Avatar" button. You will then be able to choose from an assortment of avatars. At this stage I will not be adding the ability to upload your own avatars, but if the site gets more popular I will consider adding this feature.</p>
    <h3>Password/Username/Email changes</h3>
    <p>If you need to change your password, username and/or email, please visit "Your Account" page.</p>
    <h3>Email</h3>
    <p>Upon sign up you will need to provide your email address. At this stage your email will only be used when you need to recover your account password. Or if you wish to sign in using your email rather than your username. Your email address will not be disclosed to anyone. When filling out the contact form, your email will be used to respond to your enquiry/suggestion.</p>
    <p>In the future, 'subscriptions' may be set up if the site becomes popular. In which case a newsletter with details of recent activity will be emailed out, but only if you subscribe.</p>
