Motion Sickness Gaming<br>
This was a originally a project for my Diploma in Website Development.<br>
This is a forum-style website for gamers who experience motion sickness while playing games.<br>

## Users can do the following:
- Create an account with a username, email and password
- Sign in with their username / Sign out
- Change their password
- Recover their password if forgotten
- Add games to the library
- Add comments and fixes
- Vote on whether a game gives them motion sickness
- Vote on other users comments and fixes
- Receive reputation based on likes/dislikes they have received for their comments/fixes

## Changes that I am working on adding:
- Allow users to delete their own comments/fixes
- Allow users to edit their own comments/fixes
- Allow users to change their email address and username
- Allow users to sign in with their username OR email address
- Currently when a user adds a comment, their 'enters' for new paragraphs don't show and displays as one big paragraph. Need to fix this
- Add 'double password' for registration, change password and recover password to pick up typing errors and prevent incorrect password being entered for users
- Allow comments on blogs
- Allow multiple levels of replies (currently only one level of replies allowed)
