Motion Sickness Gaming
This project is for my assignment for a Diploma in Website Development.
The website is to build a community for gamers who experience motion sickness with certain games. 
It will need to be able to do the following:
  - New users can create/register an account
  - Registered users (RU) can login and logout
  - RU's can add games that give them motion sickness to the library
  - RU's can commment on games that are in the library
  - RU's can add possible in-game fixes for the games
  - RU's can comment on these fixes
  - Anyone can vote on a game as to whether it gives them motion sickness
  - Anyone can vote on the fixes as to whether it worked for them or not
  - Anyone can vote on RU's comments
  - RU's will have reputation based on votes (2 different types of reputation (fixes, comments))
