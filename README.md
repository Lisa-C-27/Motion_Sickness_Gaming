Motion Sickness Gaming<br>
This project is for my assignment for a Diploma in Website Development.<br>
The website is to build a community for gamers who experience motion sickness with certain games.

## It will need to be able to do the following (tick when completed):
- [x] 3 account status/levels = Admin, Active, Disabled
- [x] New users can create/register an account which will default as 'Active'
- [x] Prevent duplicate usernames from being created
- [x] Registered users (RU) can login and logout (RU = Admin, Active)
- [x] Disabled accounts will not be able to login
- [x] RU's can add games that give them motion sickness to the library
- [x] Prevent duplicate games from being added to the library
- [x] RU's can comment on games that are in the library
- [x] RU's can add possible in-game fixes for the games
- [x] RU's can comment on these fixes
- [x] Anyone can vote on a game as to whether it gives them motion sickness
- [ ] Anyone can vote on the fixes as to whether it worked for them or not
- [ ] Anyone can vote on RU's comments
- [ ] Admin can delete comments
- [x] RU's will have reputation based on votes (2 different types of reputation (fixes, comments))
